## Project Description

My project is a restaurant style game in which the player can move their character around to accept orders from incoming customers and complete tasks related to the orders. Moving to different stations within the kitchen setting will trigger new screens in which the player will be able to complete a task, such as frying a dish or chopping ingredients.
